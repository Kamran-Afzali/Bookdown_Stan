### An introduction to Bayesian Models in R and Rstan

The **Bayesian Modeling in R and Stan** posts serves as an introduction to Bayesian modeling, guiding readers through the process of fitting Bayesian models using Stan and R. It covers the basics of Stan's programming language, model specification, and provides a simple example of linear regression with simulated data. These posts collectively offer valuable insights and practical guidance for statisticians and data scientists interested in applying Bayesian methods to various modeling challenges using R and Stan. The **Bayesian Regularized Regression** post explores Bayesian analogues of regularized linear regression models, such as LASSO and Ridge regression. It discusses shrinkage and regularization techniques to improve prediction and handle models with numerous variables. The author provides examples of implementing these methods in a Bayesian framework using Stan.  In **Bayesian Robust t-Regression for Non-Normal Residuals**, the author addresses the issue of outliers affecting regression coefficients by introducing robust regression methods using the t-distribution. By modeling residuals with heavier tails, the approach reduces the influence of outliers, leading to more reliable estimates. The post includes R and Stan code for implementing Bayesian t-regression models. The **Bayesian Regression Models for Non-Normal Data** post focuses on fitting regression models suitable for non-normally distributed data, specifically using binomial and negative-binomial distributions. The author demonstrates how to implement these models in Stan, providing code examples and discussing the interpretation of results.
